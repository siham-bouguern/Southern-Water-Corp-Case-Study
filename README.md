## Project Description
This is the capstone project submitted to graduate from the [InnovatiCS AI](https://www.innovatics.ai/) training program in Data Science.
## Problem Statement
What opportunity exists for Southern Water Corporation to increase revenue by studying the Cost to Produce water and resolve sizable discrepancies in the calendar year's budget?

## Context
Southern Water Corp faces an increase in demand for desalinated water for public, private, and residential consumption. Due to the continual demand, the revenues have surged, and management is looking into improvement areas. SW Corp has three functional plants (Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik), and due to constant demand, the plants are functioning above and beyond.
The management has asked to provide accountability and a detailed breakdown for Cost to Produce (CTP) water. Financial Business Unit (FBU) has been asked to look into Year-to-Date Variance Analysis to find sizable discrepancies in budget figures and present high-level aggregation of the financial data.

## Criteria for success
- Encounter sizable discrepancies between the actual and budget figures.
- Finding accountability in Cost to Produce water (CTP) drivers.
- Detect unusual figures in the business' financial health reports

## Scope of solution space
- Revenue, Production Costs, Earning before interest, and tax (EBIT), Depreciation, and Amortization.
- Year-to-Date Variance Analysis for actual and budget figures
- Cost to produce (CTP) drivers
